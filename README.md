# qr-code-generator
Here to generate qr code and its url in text file, I have used three module.
1)inquirer module:- It provides the user interface and the inquiry session flow.
2)qr-image module:- It will store the qr image by making new .png file.
3)fs module:- It will store the url of generated qr code in a text file.
